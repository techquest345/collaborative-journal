did some really cool stuff today
what was it?
created my first righful github account 
created my first repository, cloned it, did some local commits
and when I tried to push the changes to the remote repository
I came across an error. which did not let me do my job
so I searched online and found git-credential-manager
did some reading installed and configured it. 
now when I pushed the code a login window popped up
I entered the credentials and boom it worked this time
I finally pushed code to a remote repository for the first time.
this file is to check if the credentials are stored correctly
and that I do not need to enter the credentials again and again.

let's hope for the best
